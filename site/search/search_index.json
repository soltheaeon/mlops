Each of the modules delivers dozens of hours of hands-on practice using real-world examples. The program has been carefully crafted with industry needs in mind, so you will be prepared for a wide range of challenges and set yourself apart from other AI Engineers.

About 80% never reach deployment [...] and those that do are only profitable about 60% of the time. (Wilson Pang, 2020: venturebeat.com ) These numbers paint a grim picture, especially considering that it calls into question the value added by AI Engineers. Therefore, to minimize the likelihood of such failure, it is up to us to set realistic expectations with stakeholders right from the start. After all, most AI projects fail because of at least one of the following problems: The project is poorly scoped The desired solution is not technically feasible The leap into production does not succeed Success criteria are not defined Throughout this module, we will address all of these challenges. First, however, we must agree on the following premise: We AI Engineers are service providers; we should always consider the needs of the user first. So our raison d'\u00eatre is to solve problems, not to use the most interesting and advanced algorithms possible. The latter only serves our intellectual satisfaction, not the business. To gain an initial overview of the project requirements, the following three-step process is useful (Goku Mohandas, 2021: madewithml.com ): Visualize the ideal solution, i.e. how would the problem be solved if there were no constraints? Learn how the problem is currently being solved. Frame the solution you can provide. This includes factoring in the following points: Automation or augmentation: Will you replace or support the user? Once trust in the solution grows, one can extend the augmentation solution to an automation. User Experience constraints: To whom is the product made available? How does this relate to privacy concerns? How personalized does the solution need to be? Technical constraints: What data is available? How much time is granted for development? How performant should the system be? How interpretable must the predictions be? What prediction latency can be tolerated? The Machine Learning lifecycle Developing Machine Learning solutions is not a linear process. Nevertheless, a number of sub-processes can be identified that come with their own challenges. The sequence suggested here can be broken by falling back to previous steps. Planning & project setup: Specify the requirements and the goals Allocate project resources Data collection & labeling: Collect training instances (historical cases or via sensors) In case of supervised learning: annotate with ground truth Training & debugging: Produce baseline model (often rule-based/deterministic) Find state-of-the-art model(s) and reproduce it (or them) Iterate on the baseline model given your experiments Deploying & testing: Write tests to prevent regressions Evaluate for biases Roll out in production As mentioned above, one may revert to previous steps. Reasons for this may be, for example, the following: You realize obtaining the necessary data is too hard or labeling a different task is easier. You realize the number of data points is insufficient or the data is of poor quality. You realize that the modeling task is too hard given the requirements and resources. You realize there is a mismatch between training data and data seen in deployment. Prioritizing projects Agrawal, Gans, and Goldfarb describe what makes AI economically viable in their book ' Prediction Machines: The Simple Economics of Artificial Intelligence ' (2018): AI reduces the cost of generating predictions. Predictions inform decision makers. If the predictions are reliable enough and the subsequent decision can be technically automated, then the AI can make decisions itself. If predictions are cheap, it means they are scalable and can enable decisions that were not possible before (such as in the case of Uber: recruit a driver). The implication from this is that Machine Learning projects should be prioritized that, on the one hand, allow cheap predictions and, on the other hand, have a large business impact. This gives rise to the two dimensions to be considered: The business impact and feasibility (e.g. cost). In order to come up with high-impact Machine Learning projects, consider the following questions: Where can you take advantage of cheap prediction? Where can you automate complicated processes? What are other people/businesses doing? For assessing the feasibility of Machine Learning for a given problem scenario, consider the following points: Are you sure you need Machine Learning at all? Carefully define success criteria with all stakeholders Consider the ethics and data privacy concerns related to the usage of Machine Learning Do a literature review Try to rapidly collect a labeled benchmark dataset Build a minimal viable product (MVP), potentially rule-based/deterministic After all of these steps, are you still sure you need Machine Learning at all?
