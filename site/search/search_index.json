Many data professionals therefore lack the skill set to profitably leverage their modeling expertise. Over several modules, we teach the most sought-after industry skills of AI Engineers. Each of the modules delivers dozens of hours of hands-on practice using real-world examples. The program has been carefully crafted with industry needs in mind, so you will be prepared for a wide range of challenges and set yourself apart from other AI Engineers. At this stage, the following modules are being planned and realized: MLOps: Modeling, Deploying and Monitoring Data Engineering: Extract, Transform and Load Applied Computer Vision Applied Natural Language Processing Privacy-preserving and decentralized AI Web and Mobile Application Development Autonomous Mobile Robotics About the MLOps: Modeling, Deploying and Monitoring module Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.

About 80% never reach deployment [...] and those that do are only profitable about 60% of the time. (Wilson Pang, 2020: venturebeat.com ) These numbers paint a grim picture, especially considering that it calls into question the value added by AI Engineers. Therefore, to minimize the likelihood of such failure, it is up to us to set realistic expectations with stakeholders right from the start. After all, most AI projects fail because of at least one of the following problems: The project is poorly scoped The desired solution is not technically feasible The leap into production does not succeed Success criteria are not defined Throughout this module, we will address all of these challenges. First, however, we must agree on the following premise: We AI Engineers are service providers; we should always consider the needs of the user first. So our raison d'\u00eatre is to solve problems, not to use the most interesting and advanced algorithms possible. The latter only serves our intellectual satisfaction, not the business. To gain an initial overview of the project requirements, the following three-step process is useful (Goku Mohandas, 2021: madewithml.com ): Visualize the ideal solution, i.e. how would the problem be solved if there were no constraints? Learn how the problem is currently being solved. Frame the solution you can provide. This includes factoring in the following points: Automation or augmentation: Will you replace or support the user? Once trust in the solution grows, one can extend the augmentation solution to an automation. User Experience constraints: To whom is the product made available? How does this relate to privacy concerns? How personalized does the solution need to be? Technical constraints: What data is available? How much time is granted for development? How performant should the system be? How interpretable must the predictions be? What prediction latency can be tolerated? The Machine Learning lifecycle Developing Machine Learning solutions is not a linear process. Nevertheless, a number of sub-processes can be identified that come with their own challenges. The sequence suggested here can be broken by falling back to previous steps. Planning & project setup: Specify the requirements and the goals Allocate project resources Data collection & labeling: Collect training instances (historical cases or via sensors) In case of supervised learning: annotate with ground truth Training & debugging: Produce baseline model (often rule-based/deterministic) Find state-of-the-art model(s) and reproduce it (or them) Iterate on the baseline model given your experiments Deploying & testing: Write tests to prevent regressions Evaluate for biases Roll out in production Prioritizing projects Archetypes Metrics and baselines Git repositories loooo Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor invidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
